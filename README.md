## Summary

Interview Garden is a social platform for preparing IT technical interviews. I strive to provide you with the best learning experience in preparing interviews for companies in the IT industry.

To be successful in landing a software engineer job offer, I believe it is mainly repeating these three important steps:

Share.  Practice.  Interview.

I strive to provide you the Interview Garden platform as the ultimate solution for preparing technical interviews.

1. Share -> Share questions/solutions using the question/answer posting system.
2. Practice -> Practice high quality questions/solutions featuring in-depth thought process.
3. Interview -> Practice your thoughts about the problem with real interviewers.

I hope that through my platform, you will grow into a Interview Ninja. Not only will you be successful in all of your interviews, and most importantly, you will be a smarter programmer in general !
